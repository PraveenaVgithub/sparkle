                <h2>OUR STORY</h2>

                <p>During my childhood, I witnessed my mother's tradition of donating clothes ,

                which sparked my curiosity about the practice's infrequency.

                 This led me to realize the disconnect between donors and NGOs,

                 stemming from a lack of awareness, trust issues, or logistical challenges.

                  Motivated by this realization, SPARKLESHARE emerged as a solution to bridge this gap

                  and facilitate seamless clothing donations between donors and NGOs.</p>
